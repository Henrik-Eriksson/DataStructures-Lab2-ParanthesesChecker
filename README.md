This lab assignment involves implementing a stack in C to check for balanced parentheses in an input string. The program defines functions push, pop, and peek to manipulate a stack of characters. The push function adds a character to the stack, pop removes the top element, and peek returns the latest added element. The main logic checks if each opening bracket in the input string (like (, [, {) has a corresponding closing bracket (like ), ], }). The program also includes additional checks to ensure proper nesting of different types of brackets. If the parentheses are balanced and properly nested, the program outputs "Balanced"; otherwise, it indicates "Not Balanced".
